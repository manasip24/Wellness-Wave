# WellnessWave Database Management System (DBMS)

## Introduction
Welcome to the WellnessWave Database Management System (DBMS) project. Our aim is to provide a robust platform for managing and analyzing health and wellness data, empowering individuals on their journey to optimal health. This README provides an overview of the project's mission, structure, and key components.

## Mission Statement
At WellnessWave, our mission is clear: we are dedicated to empowering individuals on their path to optimal health and wellness. Through the use of personalized, data-driven insights and support, we seek to revolutionize how people manage their well-being. Our DBMS, WellnessWave, plays a pivotal role in achieving this mission by centralizing and analyzing critical health and wellness data.

## Database Structure
Our DBMS comprises several key tables that organize and store essential data for a comprehensive health and wellness management experience:
- **User_T Table (30):** This table houses user profiles and details.
- **Health_Data Table (30):** It contains individual health metrics and records.
- **Wellness_Advice Table (20):** This table provides wellness tips and information.
- **Exercise_Routine Table (20):** Here, you'll find details of various exercise routines.
- **Meal_Plan Table (25):** This table stores nutritional plans and dietary information.
- **Health_Buddy Table (25):** It facilitates connections among users for mutual health support.
- **Professional_Advisor Table (10):** This table contains information about health professionals.

## Normalization
In our database design, we prioritize data integrity and efficiency. We have confirmed that all tables adhere to the second normal form (2NF) standard by having single-column primary keys. Additionally, we are actively working on transitioning to the third normal form (3NF) to eliminate transitive dependencies and further enhance data integrity while reducing redundancy.
